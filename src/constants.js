/**
 * ONE reviewable place for everything Jev sees and every threshold the policy uses.
 *
 * Jev (TypeSafe "System One") does not generate text. Each request carries the
 * current `state` (transcript + page snapshot) and a fan-out of typed questions
 * that are answered independently and in parallel. Code owns control flow.
 *
 * Rules applied here (from docs.typesafe.ai):
 *  - question ids are NOT sent to the model, so every `instructions` is a complete question
 *  - reference state with backticked paths (`transcript`, `page.site`, `elements`)
 *  - Choice options use the same contrastive shape {what, not_for, examples}
 *  - always include a `none` option; never ask Jev to count or generate
